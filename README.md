## Hi there 👋

💡 My name is Charlotte d'Huart and I'm a freelance Data Analyst. 
After spending 10 years in the tourism industry, first as a **web project manager**, then as a **web analyst**, I decided to acquire advanced data skills to deep dive into data-related business analysis. I recently graduated from **"Le Wagon" Data Analytics Bootcamp** 🚂, an intensive 2-month data training, and I can't wait to use my new knowledge in "real-life" use cases.

🔍 **I’m currently looking for a mission: feel free to contact me!**
